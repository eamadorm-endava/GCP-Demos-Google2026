## Slide 1: Title Slide
*   **Headline:** ShelfLogic AI
*   **Sub-headline:** The Self-Optimizing Store Network
*   **Visual:** Hero image of the Dashboard on a laptop + Mobile view on a phone.
*   **Footer:** "From Reactive Reporting to Proactive Prescription"

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
*   **Headline:** The "Data Rich, Insight Poor" Trap
*   **Bullets:**
    *   Retailers generate terabytes of POS data daily.
    *   Managers spend 80% of time *finding* problems (Spreadsheets, BI Dashboards) and only 20% *fixing* them.
    *   **The Cost:** $1.1 Trillion lost globally to "Distortion" (Out-of-Stocks + Overstocks).
*   **Visual:** A messy Excel sheet covered in red "X" marks.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
*   **Headline:** Don't Just Report. Prescribe.
*   **Core Concept:** An autonomous agent that monitors the network 24/7.
*   **The 3-Step Loop:**
    1.  **Detect:** Identify inefficiencies (Dead stock, pricing gaps).
    2.  **Solve:** Use Lookalike Modeling (Digital Twins) to propose the *perfect* fix.
    3.  **Execute:** One-click write-back to ERP/WMS systems.

## Slide 4: Feature Deep Dive (The "Big 3")
*   **Visual:** Split screen showing the three main Opportunity Cards.
1.  **Assortment Swap:** "Stop guessing. Copy what works." (Vector Similarity)
2.  **Price Optimization:** "Maximize the Revenue Hill." (Elasticity Modeling)
3.  **Inventory Rebalance:** "Prevent stockouts before they happen." (Burndown Forecasting)

## Slide 5: The "Brain" (Technology)
*   **Headline:** Powered by Advanced Machine Learning
*   **Diagram:**
    *   **Input:** Iowa Liquor Sales Data (Transactions, Geo, Census).
    *   **Processing:**
        *   *Clustering:* KNN & PCA (Finding Digital Twins).
        *   *Regression:* OLS (Price Sensitivity).
        *   *Forecasting:* LightGBM (Demand Prediction).
    *   **Output:** Actionable JSON "Opportunities".

## Slide 6: The User Experience
*   **Headline:** Tailored Views for Every Role
*   **Left Side (HQ Strategy):** "Strategic Control." Network topology, aggregate financials, algorithm tuning.
*   **Right Side (Store Execution):** "Operational Simplicity." Task lists, simple alerts, one-tap approvals.

## Slide 8: Implementation Roadmap
*   **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6): Foundation & Data Integration.** Establish Google Cloud infrastructure and build a unified "Golden Dataset" in BigQuery.
*   **Phase 2 (Weeks 7-14): Core ML Model Development.** Train, validate, and deploy the Lookalike, Pricing, and Forecasting models on Vertex AI.
*   **Phase 3 (Weeks 15-22): Agent Logic & Application Build.** Develop the React application and the autonomous agent logic to generate opportunities.
*   **Phase 4 (Weeks 23-26): Productionalization & Scale.** Deploy the full solution, establish MLOps pipelines for automated retraining, and go live.

## Slide 9: Impact & ROI
*   **Headline:** Proven Value Drivers
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **+2-5%** Same Store Sales (Assortment Mix)
    *   **-15%** Reduction in Stockouts (Inventory Rebalancing)
    *   **+10%** Margin Improvement (Dynamic Pricing)
*   **Closing:** "ShelfLogic turns your data into your best district manager."

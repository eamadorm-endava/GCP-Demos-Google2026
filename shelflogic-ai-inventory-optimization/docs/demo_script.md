## Part 1: The Strategic View (HQ Role)

**Goal:** Demonstrate high-level network visibility and the AI's ability to find "Needle in the Haystack" opportunities.

**0:00 - Login Screen**
*   **Action:** Start on the Login Page.
*   **Narrator:** "Welcome to ShelfLogic AI. Traditionally, managing a retail network means wading through spreadsheets of stale data. Today, we're going to see how an Autonomous Agent can not just report problems, but prescribe solutions."
*   **Action:** Click **[HQ Administrator]**.

**0:30 - HQ Dashboard (Morning Briefing)**
*   **Action:** Land on Dashboard. Hover over the "Morning Briefing" banner.
*   **Narrator:** "I log in as Sarah, the Regional VP. Immediately, I'm not looking at a grid of numbers. I'm looking at a 'Feed of Opportunities'. The AI has analyzed our entire network overnight and prioritized actions by projected revenue lift."
*   **Action:** Point to the Stats Cards (+2.4% Revenue, 12 Active Optimizations).
*   **Narrator:** "You can see here—we have $18k in Dead Stock value that the system has flagged."

**1:00 - Assortment Swap (The 'Digital Twin' Logic)**
*   **Action:** Click **[Analyze]** on the *Assortment Swap* card for **Dubuque**.
*   **Narrator:** "Let's look at this recommendation for our Dubuque store. The agent has flagged 'Brand X Schnapps' as dead inventory."
*   **Action:** Mouse over the Map visualization.
*   **Narrator:** "Now, normally I'd guess what to replace it with. But look at the map. The AI has identified that our **Davenport** location is a 'Digital Twin'—94% demographic similarity."
*   **Action:** Hover over the 'Tale of the Tape' chart tooltips.
*   **Narrator:** "Income, foot traffic, basket size—they are nearly identical. Yet, Davenport sells 40 units of 'Apple Liqueur' a month. Dubuque carries none."
*   **Action:** Click **[Execute Swap]**.
*   **Narrator:** "The math is undeniable. I click 'Execute', and the planogram update is sent directly to the store."

**2:00 - Price Optimization (Elasticity)**
*   **Action:** Click **[Analyze]** on the *Price Optimization* card.
*   **Narrator:** "Next, pricing. We're often leaving money on the table. Here, the AI used regression analysis to find that this Vodka is price *inelastic*."
*   **Action:** Show the 'Revenue Hill' chart.
*   **Narrator:** "We can raise the price by 8%—increasing margin—without sacrificing volume. The model projects the revenue curve for me."
*   **Action:** Click **[Apply New Price]**.
*   **Narrator:** "Done. Electronic Shelf Labels are updated instantly."

**3:00 - ML Strategy Lab (The "Glass Box")**
*   **Action:** Click **[ML Strategy Lab]** in the sidebar.
*   **Narrator:** "How do we trust these decisions? We built a 'Glass Box' view. Here in the Lab, data scientists can see the actual Clustering algorithms (Click 'Assortment'), the Elasticity Curves (Click 'Price'), and the Stock Burndown forecasts (Click 'Forecasting') driving the logic."

**4:15 - Inventory Task (Stock Transfer)**
*   **Action:** Click on the **Incoming Stock Transfer** task.
*   **Narrator:** "I see a transfer request. The system predicted I'd run out of IPA by Friday. It automatically routed surplus from Davenport."
*   **Action:** Watch the Truck Animation.
*   **Narrator:** "I didn't have to call anyone. The stock just shows up. I click 'Initiate', and the loop is closed."

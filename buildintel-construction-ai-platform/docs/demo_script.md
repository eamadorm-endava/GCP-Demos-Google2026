# BuildIntel: Product Demo Script

**Persona:** CTO of a Global Construction Firm.
**Context:** Reviewing the health of a major Data Center portfolio.

---

### Scene 1: The Portfolio "God View"
**Visual:** `PortfolioDashboard`
**Narration:**
"Good morning. As a CTO, I need to know where the fires are before they burn down the project. Here in the Global Portfolio view, I see my 9 active data center builds.
BuildIntel immediately highlights that 2 projects are 'Critical Risk'. I see a $1.2M variance across the portfolio. Let's drill into 'Titan Hyperscale' in Ashburn, which is flagged High Risk."
**Action:** Click on "Titan Hyperscale".

### Scene 2: The Project Dashboard & Predictive Summary
**Visual:** `Dashboard` (Project View)
**Narration:**
"I'm now in the project command center. The first thing I see isn't just a static report—it's a **Predictive Insight** generated by Gemini.
It tells me: 'Steel erection rate is 15% slower than plan.' This isn't just looking back; it's forecasting a 12-day delay if we don't act.
I can also filter the noise. By adjusting this **Confidence Threshold** slider to 85%, I only see the alerts the AI is extremely sure about."
**Action:** Move Risk Threshold slider.

### Scene 3: Autonomous Risk Agents
**Visual:** `RiskPage`
**Narration:**
"How did we catch that steel delay? That's the power of **Agents**.
We have 'Schedule Guardians' and 'Budget Watchdogs' running 24/7.
I want to deploy a new agent to monitor concrete quality. I'll click 'Deploy New Agent'.
I don't need to be a coder. I just select 'Quality Control' and use the **AI Suggestions** to generate a prompt: 'Monitor daily logs for concrete cure times > 48 hours.'
Click Deploy. Now, Gemini scans every PDF and log for that specific pattern."
**Action:** Open Modal, select Quality, click suggestion, Deploy.

### Scene 4: Deep Dive - Schedule & RFI Impact
**Visual:** `SchedulePage`
**Narration:**
"Let's solve a specific problem. The schedule shows a delay. Why?
I go to the Schedule & RFI page. I see 'Blocking RFIs'.
I select this 'Steel Beam Clash' RFI.
BuildIntel runs an instant **Impact Analysis**.
Result: '+14 Days Predicted Delay'. It explicitly links this RFI to task 'T202'.
I can see the ripple effect. If I change the priority to 'Low', the AI re-evaluates. If I keep it 'High', I know I need to call the structural engineer immediately."
**Action:** Select RFI, view Impact Analysis panel.

---

### Scene 5: Intelligence Hub (Chat)
**Visual:** `IntelligenceHub`
**Narration:**
"Finally, for everything else, I have the Intelligence Hub.
I can ask: 'Draft an email to the structural team summarizing the impact of RFI-1042.'
Gemini drafts the email, citing the specific delay days and cost implications we just analyzed.
This turns data into action."
**Action:** Type prompt in chat, view response.

**Closing:**
"This is BuildIntel. It turns our data archives into a proactive defense system, ensuring we deliver faster and more predictably."
